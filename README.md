    About OnlySats
  </h3>
  <p align="center">
    Open source content creator platform with Bitcoin-only payments
  </p>
</p>

Introduction
----------------------------

**What is OnlySats?**

- Broad strokes: OnlyFans on Bitcoin
- Open Source, too. Mostly turnkey but must be deployed to your own server
- Privacy first and Tor-enabled

**Why OnlySats?**

- Censorship-resistant content sharing is needed now more than ever. If the content is legal but still undesired by the powers that be, they can censor you by restricting payments. Bitcoin fixes this.
- Content creators shouldn't need to pass off 25% or more of their money to a glorified web hosting provider.
